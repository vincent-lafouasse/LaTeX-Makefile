# A simple Makefile for LaTeX using latexmk

## Introduction

`latexmk` is a powerful tool to properly compile `.tex` projects.

Compiling `.tex` files may take several runs of compilation to properly output, especially when cross-referencing and indexing (citations, label/ref and table of contents).

`latexmk` will automatically do everything for you so you may just use the command `$latexmk myfile.tex`.

So `latexmk` is actually already a great tool to automate the compilation of `.tex` documents (which explains why my Makefile is so succinct).
The only problem with `latexmk` is that it puts all auxilliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.bbl`, etc.) in the same directory as the `.tex`, which can get messy, especially with several `.tex` files.
This Makefile just runs `latexmk` then puts all those nasty files in the `aux/` directory which is removed with the target `clean`.

Note that the command `$latexmk` will compile all `.tex` files in the directory.

## Features #

- [X] Properly compiles all TeX projects (a feature of `latexmk`).

- [X] `all` target that makes all `.tex` in the master directory and outputs `.pdf` files by default. Just use the command `$make`.

- [X] Puts the shell output of the compilation (the standard output) in `tmp/yourfile/out` to avoid clutter in the shell and only have necessary information showing.

- [X] If the compilation fails, show the tail of `tmp/yourfile/out` for debugging purposes.

- [X] Puts everything but the `.tex` and the output file (`.pdf` or `.dvi` etc) in `aux/yourfile/` to avoid clutter in your master directory.

- [X] Removes unneeded files using `$make clean` or `$make mrproper` (see "Commands").

- [X] Default output type is `.pdf` but compatible with `.dvi` and `.ps` (see "Commands").


### To be implemented

- [ ] Selective `clean` and `mrproper` targets that will only delete the aux files from a certain project instead of removing the whole `aux/` directory.



## Requirements

If you use LaTeX, you probably already have the requirements for this Makefile.

- `latexmk` is a Perl script, so you may have to install [Perl](https://www.perl.org).

- Obviously, the package `latexmk` should be installed, tho for me, it came with my LaTeX distribution. It comes with MikTex and MacTex.

## Use

Just put the Makefile in the same directory as your `.tex` file and use the command `$make myfile.pdf` in the shell while in the directory containing your `.tex`.

You may also use the command `$make`to compile all `.tex` files and output `.pdf` files.

I personnally put the Makefile in a dedicated directory and create a symbolic link in each of my TeX projects.


#### Commands

- `$make` will compile all `.tex` files in the directory and outputs by default `.pdf` files.

- `$make pdf`, `$make dvi` and `$make ps` do the same as `make` but output the desired file types. Note that `$make pdf` and `$make` are equivalent.

- `$make myfile.pdf` will compile your project and output a `.pdf`. Note that you may also make `.dvi` and `.ps` files.

- `$make clean` clears everything but the `.tex` and the output file (for me `.pdf` but it won't clear `.dvi` and `.ps` either).

- `$make mrproper` clears everything but the `.tex`.

- `$make help` shows this README in the shell.

Note that `$make clean` and `$make mrproper` will clear auxilliary files from ALL projects in the `aux/` directory (it removes the whole `aux/`). Selective `clean` and `mrproper` which would only clear the auxilliary files from a selected project is to be implemented.
